## Preface

Star Road the Gathering,
called “World Peace” originally,
was my game
designed in Form 1.

Star Road the Gathering,
Decrypt Adventure,
Matches Man,
Mario the Board Game 
are in “Big 4 Project”.

(Hall Six is not in “Big 4”)

## History

遊戲原先跟平常玩法相若 -
透過猜贏其他人，
獲得一次製造武器的機會。

其後因武器越畫越多，
引伸用一疊紙記錄所有武器，
起名 “大集會”。

因不想武器功能重疊，
引伸某些須猜贏多次才能製好，
同時攻擊力較大。

及後發覺以猜拳決定
誰可製造武器太重運氣成份，
演變成現時固定
獲得製造武器機會。
(現時稱作 “生產物件”。
武器是物件其中一種。)
