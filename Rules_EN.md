## Preface

Star Road the Gathering,<br>
called “World Peace” originally,<br>
was my game designed in Form 1.

- Star Road the Gathering
- Decrypt Adventure
- Matches Man
- Mario the Board Game 
<br>
are in “Big 4 Project”.<br>

(Hall Six is not in “Big 4”)<br>



## History

遊戲原先跟平常玩法相若。<br>
透過猜贏其他人，<br>
獲得一次製造武器的機會。<br>

其後因武器越畫越多，<br>
引伸用一疊紙記錄所有武器，<br>
起名 “大集會”。<br>

因不想武器功能重疊，<br>
引伸某些須猜贏多次才能製好，<br>
同時攻擊力較大。<br>

及後發覺以猜拳決定<br>
誰可製造武器太重運氣成份，<br>
演變成現時固定<br>
獲得製造武器機會。<br>
(現時稱作 “生產物件”。<br>
武器是物件其中一種。)<br>

*: Team Leader <br>



## Bouns and Penalty System 

Disclose his/her Team Card <br>
when that player is destroyed. <br>

1. You faced up your Team Card, and...<br>
destroy same team player,<br>
ALL your objects on your <br>
production line are destroyed. <br>
Otherwise, you gain 3[W] <br>
(place in your Storage), <br>
and may allocate to any players. <br>

2. You faced down your Team Card, then... <br>
your team is undetermined.<br>
Destroy any players will not<br>
trigger the system.<br>



## Before game start

Each player:
 1) Gain 12 resource indicator [W] 
 - 4[W] as storage (written as {W})<br>
(place beside Production Line)
 - 8[W] as HP (place on Team Card)

>You share HP with Base. <br>
>When your Base is 0[W], <br>
>you are destroyed and <br>
>cannot play the game. <br>

 2) Get your colour
 - Each player random draw 1 Team Card <br>
(based on Team Table), <br>
and face down, place on table. <br>
 - If you get “Leader”, you can <br>
face up the card at any instant. <br>

 3) Choose a character
Each player random draw 2 Character Card, <br>
pick one, face up and place on table. <br>

Remaining materials place in common area. <br>
Finally, random choose a player to start the game. <br>
Game flows in anti-clockwise direction. <br>



## Game in Progress 

 - Game is in turn-based 
 - Each player in his/her turn have to play 4 Stages <br>
with the following order.
 1. Beginning of Stage 
 2. Supplement Stage
 3. Action Stage
 4. End of Stage
 - Any player end turn, pass to the next player.

**Rules for 1st cycle:** <br>
All players except the last one, <br>
cannot use objects in the first cycle.



## 4 Stages

**Beginning of Stage** <br>
Usually skipped.

**Supplement Stage** <br>
Gain 2[W] and place in Storage.

**Action Stage** <br>
You may do unlimited times 
and in any order, 
to produce objects and
use objects.<br>
(until you cannot do or
do not want to do.)

**End of Stage** <br>
Usually skipped.



## Produce Object

1) Take a stand and digit pieces. <br>
Place 4 digit pieces in the stand <br>
to form an object.
> These 4 number treat as a code <br>
> and cannot be changed afterward. 
2) Place the object on the lower platform <br>
on a Production Line.<br>
> Object position cannot be changed afterward.
3) If that position had already <br>
placed an object, place on its upper platform.
4) Take X[W] from your storage and  <br>
place beside the object.
> Maximum of X is 4 in 1 Turn
5) If its [W] reach its required resource, <br>
placed a pink indicator, <br>
which declared the object is completed.

> Objects in Production Line <br>
> must more than 0[W] and <br>
> not more than its equired resource.
>
> If it is 0[W], <br>
> removed from Production Line.
>
> If more than 0[W], <br>
> it cannot be disposed, <br>
> but can be removed when produce new object.



## Use Object

 - Object can be used after completion.
 - ALL objects can be used in any instant except weapons.
 - If using weapon, do the settlement.



## Production Line

 - Production Line is used for producing objects. <br>
In general, you have 4 Lines.
 - Production Line is classified as <br>
1st Platform and 2nd Platform. <br>
(1st in upper, 2nd in lower) <br>
Each platform can only place 1 object.
 - When spaces are full, <br>
you dispose one of the object to release space.



## Distance [d]

It is counted per head. <br>
The distance between you and your adjacent player is 1. <br>
When counting distance, <br>
always count the shortest one.



## Range of Attack [r]

Normally, the distance is 1.



## Weapon [A]

Normally, is an object which <br>
only consist of attack value (A) <br>
and no protect value (P).



## Shield [P]

Normally, is an object which <br>
only consist of protect value (P) <br>
and no attack value (A).

**Shield block settlement:** <br>
In the description (6) of “Hurt Settlement”, <br>
amend (W) with (P).

If that turn <br>
the accumulated hurt is more than its (P), Shield destroyed. <br>
Otherwise, ignore that harm.



## Mix [M]

Normally, is an object <br>
which consist of protect value (P) <br>
and attack value (A).

**Mix block settlement:** <br>
In the description (6) of “Hurt Settlement”, <br>
amend (W) with (M).

If that turn <br>
the accumulated hurt is more than its (M), Mix destroyed. <br>
Otherwise, transfer hurt to the source (player) each time.


>CANNOT <br>
>use Shield to block its rebound OR <br>
>use Mix to rebound its rebound. <br>
>Since Mix is not Weapon.



## Special [?]

I.e. Not Attack nor Protect. <br>
Normally, is an object <br>
which consist of no protect value (P) <br>
and no attack value (A).



## Object [No]

Object is described in Blue Print. <br>
Use stand and digit pieces to represent objects <br>
during the game.



## Storage {W} 

 - X{W} stand for minimum storage is X. <br>
If less than X, <br>
then cannot use that object.

 - Storage also called as <br>
Degrees of Freedom (DF) or <br>
intelligence.



## Harm Settlement 

 1) Declare using arbitrary weapons with order, <br>
turn the stand facing outward, <br>
and assign a target player.
 2) If target player is more than 1, <br>
settle one after another.
 3) Target player may choose arbitrary objects with order, <br>
to block arbitrary weapons. <br>
(optional) turn the stand facing outward.
 4) If no object blocked, <br>
weapons will hurt target player’s base directly.
 5) If objects blocked, <br>
weapons will hurt objects. 
 6) Hurt is settled as 1(W) cancel out 1(A). <br>
Remove cancelled [W] from those objects.

> **Hurt Settlement with order** <br>
>
>Settle 1st weapon against 1st blocking object...
>1. If blocking object is destroyed, <br>
>settle the remaining attack value from 1st weapon  <br>
>against 2nd blocking object.
>2. If blocking object had not destroyed, <br>
>settle 2nd weapon against <br>
>the remaining [W] from 1st blocking object. <br>
><br>
>and so on.

 7) If there exist remaining attack value <br>
after blocking, <br>
then will hurt target player’s base directly. 
 8) Weapon is destroyed after using once.



## Use Settlement

Always first settle latter, then former.<br>
After a player uses an object, <br>
should ask whether other player would use objects.



## Destroy 

Move back to common area.



## Gain

Move from common area to your field.



## Recycle [R]

**X(R)** <br>
That object will not be destroyed after use. <br>
Remove X[W] and pink indicator. <br>
It may continue to produce.



## Use Limit [UL]

**X(UL)** <br>
 - After an object is declared completed, <br>
place X pink indicator, <br>
indicate that can be use for X times.
 - When used once, remove 1 indicator. <br>
Destroy after using X times.



## Delay [t]

**X(t)** <br>
 - When using that object, <br>
place X Delay indicator, <br>
indicated that object can be used after X cycles.
 - In your beginning of stage, <br>
remove 1 indicator (of each object). <br>
Use it after remove all indicators.
